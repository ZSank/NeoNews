# NeoNews
1. This app displays news from various sources using the News API. 
2. The app was built using Kotlin programming language and follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture to ensure code maintainability and scalability. 
3. I used Retrofit to simplify HTTP calls, Moshi Converter to deserialize JSON responses, Glide library to load and cache images, and Paging 3 library to enable efficient pagination and data loading.
